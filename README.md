## Hi, I'm Alpi 👋

I have a strong passion for front-end development and web technologies, particularly TypeScript and JavaScript. I'm always seeking new challenges to apply my knowledge, firmly believing in the potential of open-source software. I'm highly motivated, eager to learn, and well-versed in writing clean code and software principles.
